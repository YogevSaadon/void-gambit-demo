# ===== RARITY PROGRESSION DESIGN =====
# PHILOSOPHY: Start with scarcity (0% legendary), create meaningful breakpoints,
# use sigmoid curves for natural progression, maintain challenge at max level
#
# BREAKPOINTS (Psychological milestones):
# - Level 1-3: Commons only (learning phase)
# - Level 4: First uncommons appear (10%)
# - Level 7: Uncommons become viable (25%)
# - Level 10: First rares appear (8%) - major milestone
# - Level 15: Rares become common (20%) - mid-game power spike
# - Level 18: First epics appear (4%) - late game transition
# - Level 22: Epics become viable (12%) - endgame preparation
# - Level 25: Full rarity access including legendaries (5%)

# ===== BASE RARITY WEIGHTS (Before level scaling) =====

	"epic": 0.0,        # Unlocks at level 18
	"legendary": 0.0    # Unlocks at level 25
